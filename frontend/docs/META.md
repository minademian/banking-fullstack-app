# Development Process

1. I put together a basic design document with basic functional and non-functional requirements, and user stories.
1. I found a simple visual design on Figma and used that as a starting point.
1. I created a boiler plate React project with `create-react-app`, powered by TypeScript.
1. I broke down the UI into a React component hierarchy and added it to the design document.
1. I implemented the basic React component hierarchy without state or visual design.
1. I created mock JSON data objects to be consumed by the components.
